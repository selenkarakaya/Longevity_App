# Longevity App ![Longevity Ap](./dist/cheese/longevity.png)

## Description
The **Longevity App** is a dynamic web application designed to help users manage their nutrition and fitness goals. By utilizing third-party APIs, this app allows users to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Body Mass Index (BMI), set daily calorie limits, and track their dietary intake and physical activity. Users can create personalized meal plans, search for nutritional information, and monitor their caloric balanceâ€”all from one convenient platform.

## Features
- **BMR and BMI Calculators**: Integrated mathematical equations to help users determine their daily caloric needs.
- **Nutrition API Integration**: Access nutritional and workout information, create recipes, and manage workout sets.
- **Caloric Tracking**: Users can input their daily calorie intake and calories burned from exercises, with the ability to search for food and workout data via the API.
- **Meal Creation**: Calculate the total calories of a meal by entering individual ingredients.
- **Caloric Summary**: The main screen displays consumed calories, burned calories, and remaining calories.
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear all user-entered data with a single button press.

## Usage
